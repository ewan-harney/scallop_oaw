Data from experiments carried out with French and Norwegian Pecten maximus spat. The aim of the experiment was to identify differential effects of ocean acidification and warming on protein abundance, metabolism and growth phenotypes in these two populations. 

Available:

**_Proteomic data_** (gel images and spot sizes)

**_Survival data_**

**_Phenotypic data_** (shell height, shell and body weight, condition index)

**_Metabolic rate_** (oxygen consumption)

**_Appendix_** (image of experimental setup, example images used to collect survival and shell height data, and annotated gel images showing actin, myosin and paramyosin spots)
