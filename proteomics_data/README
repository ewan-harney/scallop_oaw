Proteomic gel image information

There are 8 folders, corresponding to the 8 treatment and population combinations:

1_Fr_13_80 - France / 13 C / pH 8.0
2_Fr_13_77 - France / 13 C / pH 7.7
3_Fr_19_80 - France / 19 C / pH 8.0
4_Fr_19_77 - France / 19 C / pH 7.7
5_No_13_80 - Norway / 13 C / pH 8.0
6_No_13_77 - Norway / 13 C / pH 7.7
7_No_19_80 - Norway / 19 C / pH 8.0
8_No_19_77 - Norway / 19 C / pH 7.7

Within each folder are 4 images corresponding to the gels used. Gel names feature information about the "group" or batch in which they were analysed, and a 5 digit identifier.

E.g. gp2_63779 was the second batch of protemic extractions and gels, with the gel id 63779

Samples were assigned to groups randomly.

Also included are the samespots results (spot sizes), which were used for statistical analysis and creating figures:

Samespots_phia_180109.csv

Please note that here the 8 treatment/Population combinations are referred to as "Groups" (G1 - G8), and the names of the gel feature the batch id as "r" (r1-r5)
